I make a simple Card Jitsu Game Clone for iOS using SwiftUI MVVM

The code might be very disgusting, leave me alone

Most of code were purely from me. However, some of them were not, but all of them were licensed with the permission for commercial use.

```swift
struct BattleSystem { ... }
struct Grid { ... }
```
